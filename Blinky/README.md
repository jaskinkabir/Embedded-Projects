# Project Description
This project was an excercise to help me familiarize myself with TI's Code Composer Studio's project creation, building, and debugging process. It consists of a simple program that blinks an LED on the MSP432 microcontroller board. The delay is blocking and uses the builtin `__delay_cycles` function. The [Ultrasonic Alarm](../UltraSonicAlarm/README.md) project later implements delays using a hardware timer and interrupts.

The demonstration of this first project can be seen in the following video:
