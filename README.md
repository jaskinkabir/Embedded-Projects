This repo holds all the files for each project for my Embedded Systems class at UNC Charlotte. I took this class over the summer of 2023. The class went over the basics of bare-metal programming on the TI MSP432 microcontroller using Code Composer Studio. Each project builds on the previous one, adding more complexity and new peripherals.
